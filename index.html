<h3>In Saint Johns, back then we had another company other than just the Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, and Foxtrot, we had also had a car corps but they had been dispanded shortly after WWII.
These car corps had consisted of multiple cars. These cars that they had were all made by Royal Page Davidson (BORN October 9, 1870, and he DIED on January
16, 1943) he had made many types of armored cars and had done tons of extensive 
travels in his armored cars. He had made cadillacs into ballon destroyers with 50 cal brownings on them that could swivel horizontal and verticaly 180 degrees.
One time when they were traveling with these cars they had gone right through a guys drive who was making all of the other cars drive through his ditch to show how much he disliked the idea of the cars, and he had let the3 SJNMNA pass right through his drive because he had seen the guns and the guns had scared him.

<h3>
An Artifact that I can talk to you about is one of the cadillac ballon Destroyers
that Corporal Davidson had made. What he had made was he had taken the frame and engine of a cadillac, and then he had added extensive parts, like a 50 cal browning that had been able to move vertical and horizontal, 180 degrees, which had made that a good reason to get them.
The army had even started to enlist these vehicles during WWII because of how great they were wityh tracking on hard terrain. Sadly Corporal wasn't able to see this because he had passed away in 1943.
